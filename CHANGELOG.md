# Changes

* 2.4.962 -- 2022-12-17
  * Fix `set-options!` (only `:checking` worked in 2.4.947).
  * Fix `:cast` formatting when quoting is enabled, via PR [#443](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/pull/443) [duddlf23](https://github.com/duddlf23).
  * Fix [#441](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/441) by adding `:replace-into` to in-flight clause order (as well as registering it for the `:mysql` dialect).
  * Fix [#434](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/434) by special-casing `:'ARRAY`.
  * Fix [#433](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/433) by supporting additional `WITH` syntax, via PR [#432](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/432), [@MawiraIke](https://github.com/MawiraIke). _[Technically, this was in 2.4.947, but I kept the issue open while I wordsmithed the documentation]_
  * Address [#405](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/405) by adding `:numbered` option, which can also be set globally using `set-options!`.
  * Support `REPLACE INTO` syntax in SQLite by adding a `:sqlite` dialect.

* 2.4.947 -- 2022-11-05
  * Fix [#439](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/439) by rewriting how DDL options are processed; also fixes [#386](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/386) and [#437](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/437); **Whilst this is intended to be purely a bug fix, it has the potential to be a breaking change -- hence the version jump to 2.4!**
  * Fix [#438](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/438) by
  supporting options on `TRUNCATE`.
  * Address [#435](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/435) by showing `CREATE TEMP TABLE` etc.
  * Fix [#431](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/431) -- `WHERE false` differed between the DSL and the `where` helper.
  * Address [#430](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/430) by treating `:'` as introducing a name that should be treated literally and not formatted as a SQL entity (which respects quoting, dot-splitting, etc); this effectively expands the "escape hatch" introduced via [#352](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/352) in 2.2.868. _Note that the function context behavior formats as a SQL entity, rather than the usual SQL "keyword", whereas this new context is a literal transcription rather than as a SQL entity!_
  * Address [#427](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/427) by adding `set-options!`.
  * Address [#415](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/415) by supporting multiple column names in `ADD COLUMN`, `ALTER COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN`, and `MODIFY COLUMN`.

* 2.3.928 -- 2022-09-04
  * Address [#425](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/425) by clarifying that `INTERVAL` as special syntax may be MySQL-specific and PostgreSQL uses difference syntax (because `INTERVAL` is a data type there).
  * Address [#423](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/423) by supporting `DEFAULT` values and `DEFAULT` rows in `VALUES`.
  * Address [#422](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/422) by auto-quoting unusual entity names when `:quoted` (and `:dialect`) are not specified, making HoneySQL more secure by default.
  * Fix [#421](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/421) by adding `:replace-into` for `:mysql` dialect.
  * Address [#419](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/419) by adding `honey.sql.protocols` and `InlineValue` with a `sqlize` function.
  * Address [#413](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/413) by flagging a lack of `WHERE` clause for `DELETE`, `DELETE FROM`, and `UPDATE` when `:checking :basic` (or `:checking :strict`).
  * Fix [#392](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/392) by adding support for `WITH` / (`NOT`) `MATERIALIZED` -- via PR [#420](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/420) [@robhanlon22](https://github.com/robhanlon22).

* 2.3.911 -- 2022-07-29
  * Address [#418](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/418) by documenting a potential "gotcha" with multi-column `IN` expressions (a change from HoneySQL 1.x).
  * Fix [#416](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/416) via PR [#417](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/417) from [@corasaurus-hex](https://github.com/corasaurus-hex) -- using the internal default state for the integrity assertion.
  * Address [#414](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/414) by providing an example of `ORDER BY` with a `CASE` expression.
  * Address [#412](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/412) by documenting options in a separate page and reorganizing the ToC structure.
  * Address [#409](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/409) by making docstring check for public helpers conditional.
  * Fix [#406](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/406) by adding `:alter-column` (which produces `MODIFY COLUMN` when the MySQL dialect is selected) and deprecating `:modify-column`.
  * Address [#401](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/401) by adding `register-dialect!` and `get-dialect`, and also making `add-clause-before`, `strop`, and `upper-case` public so that new dialects are easier to construct.

* 2.2.891 -- 2022-04-23
  * Address [#404](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/404) by documenting PostgreSQL's `ARRAY` constructor syntax and how to produce it.
  * Address parts of [#403](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/403) by improving the documentation for `:array` and also improving the exception that was thrown when it was misused.
  * Fix [#402](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/402) by allowing for expressions in `:insert-into` table.
  * Address [#400](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/400) by adding `:table` clause.
  * Address [#399](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/399) by correcting multi-column `RETURNING` clauses in docs and tests.
  * Fix [#398](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/398) by adding `honey.sql.pg-ops` namespace that registers PostgreSQL JSON and regex operators and provides symbolic names for "unwritable" operators (that contain `@`, `#`, or `~`).
  * Address [#396](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/396) by throwing an exception if you try to cache a SQL statement that includes an `IN ()` expression, using a named parameter for the `IN` values.
  * Fix [#394](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/394) by restoring HoneySQL 1.x's behavior when quoting.
  * Fix [#387](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/387) again.
  * Update CI to reflect Clojure 1.11 release (master -> 1.11; new master is 1.12).
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.8.0.

* 2.2.868 -- 2022-02-21
  * Address [#387](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/387) by making the function simpler.
  * Fix [#385](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/385) by quoting inlined UUIDs.
  * Address [#352](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/352) by treating `:'` as introducing a function name that should be formatted as a SQL entity (which respects quoting, dot-splitting, etc), rather than as a SQL "keyword".

* 2.2.861 -- 2022-01-30
  * Address [#382](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/382) by adding `:case-expr` for BigQuery support.
  * Address [#381](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/381) by adding `generic-helper-variadic` and `generic-helper-unary` to `honey.sql.helpers`.
  * Fix [#380](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/issues/380) by correcting test for function type in `register-clause!` and `register-fn!`.

* 2.2.858 -- 2022-01-20
  * Address #377 by adding `honey.sql/map=` to convert a hash map into an equality condition (for a `WHERE` clause).
  * Address #351 by adding a `:cache` option to `honey.sql/format` (for Clojure only, not ClojureScript).
  * Address #281 by adding support for `SELECT * EXCEPT ..` and `SELECT * REPLACE ..` and `ARRAY<>` and `STRUCT<>` column types -- see [SQL Clause Reference - SELECT](https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/honeysql/CURRENT/doc/getting-started/sql-clause-reference#select-select-distinct) and [SQL Clause Reference - DDL](https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/honeysql/CURRENT/doc/getting-started/sql-clause-reference#ddl-clauses) respectively for more details.
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.6.7.

* 2.2.840 -- 2021-12-23
  * Fix #375 for `:nest` statement.
  * Fix #374 by removing aliasing of `:is` / `:is-not` -- this changes the behavior of `[:is-not :col true/false]` to be _correct_ and _include `NULL` values_. Using `:is` / `:is-not` with values that are not Boolean and not `nil` will produce invalid SQL.
  * Update test dependencies.
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.6.5.

* 2.1.833 -- 2021-12-03
  * Fix #372 by merging `:select-distinct-on` differently.
  * Add empty column list check for `SELECT` and several other clauses, when `:checking :basic` (or `:strict`) is provided.
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.6.0.

* 2.1.829 -- 2021-11-27
  * Fix #371 by treating the operand of `NOT` as a nested expression (so it is parenthesized unless it is a simple value).
  * Fix #370 by **always** parenthesizing the operand of `:nest`.
  * Address #369 by adding a big clarifying docstring to the `honey.sql.helpers` namespace pointing out that all helper functions are variadic, they are all `[& args]`, some have `:arglists` metadata to provide a more specific usage hint but those _all omit the optional first argument (the DSL hash map)_.
  * Fix #354 by supporting `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.5.5.

* 2.1.818 -- 2021-10-04
  * Fix #367 by supporting parameters in subexpressions around `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` tests.
  * Address #366 by introducing `:values-default-columns` option to control whether missing columns are treated as `NULL` or `DEFAULT` in `:values` clauses with sequences of hash maps.
  * Fix #365 -- a regression from 1.x -- where subclauses for `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, etc were incorrectly parenthesized.
  * Update `build-clj` to v0.5.0.

* 2.0.813 -- 2021-09-25
  * Address #364 by recommending how to handle PostgreSQL operators that contain `@`.
  * Fix #363 and #362 by aligning more closely the semantics of `:inline` syntax with the `:inline true` option. A side effect of this is that `[:inline [:param :foo]]` will now (correctly) inline the value of the parameter `:foo` whereas it previously produced `PARAMS SOURCE`. In addition, inlining has been extended to vector values, so `[:inline ["a" "b" "c"]]` will now produce `('a', 'b', 'c')` and `[:inline [:lift ["a" "b" "c"]]]` will now produce `['a', 'b', 'c']` which is what people seemed to expect (the behavior was previously unspecified).
  * Fix #353 by correcting handling of strings used as SQL entities (such as table names); this was a regression introduced by a recent enhancement to `:create-table`.
  * Fix #349 by adding an optional `:quoted` argument to `set-dialect!`.
  * Address #347 by adding example of adding a primary key to an existing table via `:add-index`.
  * Support `AS` aliasing in `DELETE FROM`.
  * Switch from `readme` to `test-doc-blocks` so all documentation is tested!
  * Clean up build/update deps.

* 2.0.783 -- 2021-08-15 (a.k.a "2.0 Gold")
  * Fixes #344 by no longer dropping the qualifier on columns in a `SET` clause _for the `:mysql` dialect only_; the behavior is unchanged for all other dialects.
  * Fixes #340 by making the "hyphen to space" logic more general so _operators_ containing `-` should retain the hyphen without special cases.
  * Documentation improvements: `:fetch`, `:lift`, `:limit`, `:offset`, `:param`, `:select`; also around JSON/PostgreSQL.
  * Link to the [HoneySQL web app](https://www.john-shaffer.com/honeysql/) in both the README and **Getting Started**.
  * Switch to `tools.build` for running tests and JAR building etc.

* 2.0.0-rc5 (for testing; 2021-07-17)
  * Fix #338 by producing `OFFSET n ROWS` (or `ROW` if `n` is 1) if `:fetch` is present or `:sqlserver` dialect is specified; and by producing `FETCH NEXT n ROWS ONLY` (or `ROW` is `n` is 1; or `FIRST` instead of `NEXT` if `:offset` is not present).
  * Fix #337 by switching to `clojure.test` even for ClojureScript.
  * Address #332 by improving `:cross-join` documentation.
  * Address #330 by improving exception when a non-entity is encountered where an entity is expected.
  * Fix `fetch` helper (it previously returned an `:offset` clause).
  * Fix bug in unrolling nested argument to `with-columns` helper.

* 2.0.0-rc3 (for testing; 2021-06-16)
  * Fix #328 by adding `:distinct` as special syntax, affecting an expression.
  * Address #327 by changing "unknown clause" error to including mention of "nil values" (which are also illegal).
  * Fix #327 by making single-argument helpers consistent with multi-argument helpers.
  * Support PostgreSQL's `&&` array operator.
  * Clarify how to `SELECT` a function expression (in **Getting Started**).
  * Update `test-runner`.

* 2.0.0-rc2 (for testing; 2021-05-10)
  * Fix #326 by allowing `ON`/`USING` to be optional and not dropping parameters on the floor.
  * Fix #325 by making the `%` function call syntax respect `:quoted true` and/or `:dialect` options, and also allowing for qualified column names. (PR from @lognush)
  * Add `:quoted-snake true` option to force conversion from kebab-case to snake_case when `:quoted true` or a `:dialect` is specified to `format`.
  * Update `test-runner`.

* 2.0.0-rc1 (for testing; 2021-05-06)
  * Fix #324 so that `insert-into` supports merging into another statement in all cases.
  * Fix #323 by supporting more than one SQL entity in `:on-conflict`.
  * Fix #321 by adding `:checking` mode. Currently only detects potential problems with `IN` clauses.

* 2.0.0-beta2 (for testing; 2021-04-13)
  * The documentation continues to be expanded and clarified in response to feedback!
  * Fix #322 by rewriting/simplifying `WHERE`/`HAVING` merge logic. **Important bug fix!**
  * Fix #310 by adding support for `FILTER`, `WITHIN GROUP`, and `ORDER BY` (as an expression), from [nilenso/honeysql-postgres](https://github.com/nilenso/honeysql-postgres) 0.4.112. These are [Special Syntax](doc/special-syntax.md) and there are also helpers for `filter` and `within-group` -- so **be careful about referring in all of `honey.sql.helpers`** since it will now shadow `clojure.core/filter` (it already shadows `for`, `group-by`, `into`, `partition-by`, `set`, and `update`).
  * Fix #308 by supporting join clauses in `join-by` (and correcting the helper docstring).

* 2.0.0-beta1 (for testing; 2021-04-09)
  * **The merging behavior of `where`/`having` is broken in Beta 1!**
  * Since Alpha 3, more documentation has been written and existing documentation clarified (addressing #300, #309, #313, #314).
  * Fix #319 by ensuring `register-clause!` is idempotent.
  * Fix #317 by dropping qualifiers in `:set` clauses (just like we do with `:insert` columns). Note that you can still use explicit _dotted_ names if you want table qualification.
  * Fix #316 by disallowing entity names containing `;` (to avoid SQL injection risks).
  * Fix #312 by adding `:raw` as a clause. There is no helper function equivalent (because it would be ambiguous whether you meant a function form -- `[:raw ..]` -- or a clause form -- `{:raw ..}`; and for the same reason, there is no `nest` helper function since that also works as a clause and as a function/special syntax).

* 2.0.0-alpha3 (for early testing; 2021-03-13)
  * Change coordinates to `com.github.seancorfield/honeysql` (although new versions will continue to be deployed to `seancorfield/honeysql` for a while -- see the [Clojars Verified Group Names policy](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Verified-Group-Names)).
  * Support much richer range of syntax on `CREATE`/`DROP` statements in general, including columns, `TABLESPACE`, `CASCADE`, `WITH [NO] DATA`, etc.
  * Fix #306 by supporting `CREATE TABLE .. AS ..`.
  * Fix #305 by supporting more complex join clauses.
  * Fix #303 by supporting MySQL's `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`.
  * Fix #301 by adding support for `CREATE`/`DROP`/`REFRESH` on `MATERIALIZED VIEW`.
  * Add tests to confirm #299 does not affect 2.x.
  * Fix #297 by adding both `SELECT .. INTO ..` and `SELECT .. BULK COLLECT INTO ..`.
  * Fix #295 by adding docstrings to all helper functions (and adding an assert to ensure it stays that way as more are added in future).
  * Confirm the whole of the [nilenso/honeysql-postgres](https://github.com/nilenso/honeysql-postgres) is implemented out-of-the-box (#293, up to 0.3.104 -- see also #310 which brought parity up to 0.4.112).
  * Fix #292 by adding support for `SELECT TOP` and `OFFSET`/`FETCH`.
  * Fix #284 by adding support for `LATERAL` (as special syntax, with a helper).
  * Reconcile `where` behavior with recent 1.x changes (porting #283 to 2.x).
  * Fix #280 by adding `:escape` as special syntax for regular expression patterns.
  * Fix #277 by adding `:join-by`/`join-by` so that you can have multiple `JOIN`'s in a specific order.

* 2.0.0-alpha2 (for early testing)
  * Since Alpha 1, a lot more documentation has been written and docstrings have been added to most functions in `honey.sql.helpers`.
  * Numerous small improvements have been made to clauses and helpers around insert/upsert.

* 2.0.0-alpha1 (for early testing)
  * This is a complete rewrite/simplification of HoneySQL that provides just two namespaces:
    * `honey.sql` -- this is the primary API via the `format` function as well as the various extension points.
    * `honey.sql.helpers` -- provides a helper function for every piece of the DSL that is supported out-of-the-box.
  * The coordinates for HoneySQL 2.x are `com.github.seancorfield/honeysql` so it can be added to a project that already uses HoneySQL 1.x without any conflicts, making it easier to migrate piecemeal from 1.x to 2.x.

# HoneySQL pre-2.x Changes

* 1.0.461 -- 2021-02-22
  * **Fix #299 potential SQL injection vulnerability.**

* 1.0.444 -- 2020-05-29
  * Fix #259 so column names are always unqualified in inserts. (@jrdoane)
  * Fix #257 by adding support for `cross-join` / `merge-cross-join` / `:cross-join`. (@dcj)
  * Switch dev/test pipeline to use CLI/`deps.edn` instead of Leiningen. Also add CI vi both CircleCI and GitHub Actions.
  * Switch to MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS versioning.
  * Remove macrovich dependency as this is no longer needed with modern ClojureScript.
  * Add mention of `next.jdbc` everywhere `clojure.java.jdbc` was mentioned.

* 0.9.10 -- 2020-03-06
  * Fix #254 #255 by adding support for `except`. (@ted-coakley-otm)
  * Fix #253 properly by supporting `false` as well. (@ted-coakley-otm)
  * Add cljs testing to `deps.edn`, also multi-version clj testing and new `readme` testing.

* 0.9.9 -- 2020-03-02
  * Fix #253 by supporting non-sequential join expressions.

* 0.9.8 -- 2019-09-07
  * Fix #249 by adding `honeysql.format/*namespace-as-table?*` and `:namespace-as-table?` option to `format`. (@seancorfield)

* 0.9.7 -- 2019-09-07
  * Fix #248 by treating alias as "not a subquery" when generating SQL for it. (@seancorfield)
  * Fix #247 by reverting #132 / #131 so the default behavior is friendlier for namespace-qualified keywords used for table and column names, but adds `honeysql.format/*allow-namespaced-names?*` to restore the previous behavior. A `:allow-namespaced-names?` option has been adding to `format` to set this more easily. (@seancorfield)
  * Fix #235 by adding `set0` (`:set0`) and `set1` (`:set1`) variants of `sset` (`:set`) to support different placements of `SET` (before `FROM` or after `JOIN` respectively) that different databases require. See also #200. (@seancorfield)
  * Fix #162 by adding `composite`/`:composite` constructor for values. (@seancorfield)
  * Fix #139 by checking arguments to `columns`/`merge-columns` and throwing an exception if a single collection is supplied (instead of varargs). (@seancorfield)

  * Support JDK11 (update Midje). PR #238. (@camsaul)
  * Support Turkish user.language. PR #237. (@camsaul)
  * `format-predicate` now accepts `parameterizer` as a named argument (default `:jdbc`) to match `format`. PR #234. (@glittershark)

* 0.9.4 -- 2018-10-01
  * `#sql/inline nil` should produce `NULL`. Fix #221. (@seancorfield)
  * `#sql/inline :kw` should produce `"kw"`. Fix #224 via PR #225. (@vincent-dm) Note: this introduces a new protocol, `Inlinable`, which controls inline value rendering, and changes the behavior of `#sql/inline :foo/bar` to produce just `"bar"` (where it was probably invalid SQL before).
  * Alias expressions `[:col :alias]` are now checked to have exactly two elements. Fix #226. (@seancorfield)
  * Allow `where` and `merge-where` to be given no predicates. Fix #228 and PR #230. (@seancorfield, @arichiardi)
  * `as` alias is no longer split during quoting. Fix #221 and PR #231. (@gws)
